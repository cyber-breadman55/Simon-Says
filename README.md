This is a small memory game for the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express Board that uses its buttons, lights, and sounds. There are three levels of difficulty and a scoring system. The aim of the game is to press the correct button when a light appears. This was made as a final project for ENGR 103 at OSU.

Included is a document of the current code. Please note that this code is incomplete, as I couldn't get it to a desirable spot before the deadline. Scoring system and levelling as well as MIDI sounds are there but lights won't turn on and buttons aren't really tied to a specific light. You can pretend that the buttons do stuff but technically speaking they don't.
